# Caves-of-Qud-Mod---Flora-and-Fauna-Escalated
Escalated because I put the word "enhanced" into a thesaurus and it was the funnier synonym given.  So far adding in flora from [bibelot](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1477382069) and going to try my hand at my own.  More variation yall.  

Flora:  
  Dunebush
  Abaca Plant
  Shagbark Acacia Trees
  
Fauna:
  Green Esh
